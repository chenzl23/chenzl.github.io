I am currently a Ph.D. student in College of Computer and Data Science, Fuzhou University, also a member of [Lab of Vision and Machine Learning](https://labofvisionlearning.github.io/). I am supervised by [Prof. Wenzhong Guo](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/4993.htm) and [Prof. Shiping Wang](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/8958.htm). Before that, I majored in software engineering and obtained my B.S. degree from the College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University. Now, I am also a visiting student in Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Austria, supervised by [Prof. Claudia Plant](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/59835/).

**My research interests:** Graph neural networks, Optimization-inspired deep learning, Semi-supervised learning, Low-rank optimization.
