I am currently a Ph.D. student in College of Computer and Data Science, Fuzhou University, also a member of [Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Computing and Intelligent Information Processing](https://ncip.fzu.edu.cn/). I am supervised by [Prof. Wenzhong Guo](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/4993.htm) and [Prof. Shiping Wang](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/8958.htm). Before that, I majored in software engineering and obtained my B.S. degree from the College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, in 2019. From Oct 2022 to Oct 2023, I was also a visiting scholar in Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Austria, supervised by [Prof. Claudia Plant](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/59835/). My research interests include graph neural networks, optimization-inspired deep learning and their applications. My studies have led to about 20 scientific publications on top-tier conferences and journals, including AAAI, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMM, IEEE TSP, ACM TKDD, Information Fusion, etc.
